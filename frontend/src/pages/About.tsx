        <p>
            My name is Logan Dapp, and I am a second year mechanical engineering
            and computer science major at the University of Florida. I love
            everything programming, math, and engineering, from designing control
            systems, to training my own networks, to writing embedded software,
            to writing libraries, and so forth. I'm pulled in a million directions
            all at once.

            That's all I have to say for right now; I just finished building this
            website, and it took <i>forever</i>. But now that I've gotten the
            basics ironed out, be on the lookout for more pages and content and
            whatnot.
