        <p>You may contact me through a variety of methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>logandapp@ufl.edu (email for University-related endeavors)</li>
            <li>logan@logand.app (email for business-related endeavors)</li>
            <li>@logan.dapp (Instagram)</li>
            <li>Shouting "Logan" at the top of your lungs (that one <i>really</i> works)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That's all I have to say for right now; I just finished building this
            website, and it took <i>forever</i>. But now that I've gotten the
            basics ironed out, be on the lookout for more pages and content and
            whatnot.
